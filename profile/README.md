# Welcome to Project BlazeNvim

**We are aiming to create the next-gen binginners neovim distro**

## What is this?

This  is a project to create a neovim distribution (aka a config, dotfiles or just dots related to neovim text editor program) 
for beginners to get into the vim IDE environment by collecting and setting up best and essential plugins for a beginner developer.

## Why this when there's bunch of other distros?

I created this becuase it was so hard for me when I first started as a vim explorer with the vim, neovim and even the available 
distro were filled with too much plugins that a beginner like me or you would never use and gets confusing most of the time. So this is aimed to give a simple
but not minimal yet easy to understand neovim configuration that can easily setup by executing a single command in your terminal. 

No **prerequsites** or **post-setup** crap. Just paste install command and hit enter to begin your neovim journey!! âœ¨
